2.0 TODOs:
- async API?? (by default????)
- NEON SIMD???
- allow writing with a specific palette????

RC TODOs:
- document memory usage?
- remove error handling of memory allocation failure because I've decided that's stupid
	- actually, now that I've added custom allocator support, and custom allocators might fail for various reasons, maybe don't axe this?



- async/multithreaded API
- runtime option for channel importance order?
- allow resetting thread id for more readable output from trace.cpp?
- trace.cpp cumulative time reporting tools
