RC TODOs:
- add pitch parameter
	- 0 treated as a default or left alone?
- error handling
	- how to signal what kind of thing went wrong? (mem alloc failure, invalid param, unable to create/write file)
- prefix all names at global scope
- remove multithreading from the RC
- make sure documentation is up-to-date
	- include usage example in the documentation?
	- readme





- allow resetting thread id for more readable output from trace.cpp?
- trace.cpp cumulative time reporting tools
- windows-compatible multithreading
- per-frame timing in the non-incremental API?

- allow custom allocators
- async incremental API
- runtime option for channel importance order?
- increase maximum bit depth to 16?
- bitfield for `used` array????
- API for returning a block of encoded memory instead of writing it out with <stdio.h> functions
	- or stb_image_write.h style replacement of fopen/fwrite/fclose with user-provided functions



documentation:
	- in file
	- in repository/readme
	- things to cover:
		- use case for this library
			- things this library specifically doesn't do
				- exact colors, fancy GIF features
				- image resizing (use stb_image_resize if you need this)
			- things it doesn't do *yet*, but can be supported upon request
				- support for custom allocators
				- support for writing to a memory block instead of a file
				- async API
				- support for other pixel formats (can provide optimized conversion functions for common ones that arise)
		- how much memory the library will allocate
		- API, parameter-by-parameter
		- compile-time options
	- example code for opengl app (pull from escher)
