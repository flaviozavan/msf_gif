TODO:
- multithreading (double fork/join)
- preprocessor options to turn off multithreading or intrinsics
- win+MSVC compatibility
	- intrinsics
	- pthreads
- combine header and implementation
	- rename everything at global scope to avoid name conflicts
- make sure it compiles correctly on all targets (gcc + clang + msvc, 32 + 64 bit)
- API for returning a block of encoded memory instead of writing it out with <stdio.h> functions
- comparisons to other libraries
- write documentation

- simplified API which automatically determines optimal thread counts?
- improve 
- runtime option for channel importance order?
- allow custom allocators
- increase maximum bit depth to 16?
- asserts for invalid user parameters??
- explicit error handling???
- bitfield for `used` array????



documentation:
	- in file
	- in repository
	- things to cover:
		- use case for this library
			- things this library specifically doesn't do
				- exact colors, fancy GIF features
				- image resizing (use stb_image_resize if you need this)
			- thins it doesn't to *yet*, but can be supported upon request
		- how much memory the library will allocate
		- API, parameter-by-parameter
		- compile-time options
		- performance tips
- publish and publicize
