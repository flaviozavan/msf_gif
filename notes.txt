TODO:
- document non-incremental API options
- error handling

- HMN post

- allow resetting thread id for more readable output from trace.cpp?
- win+MSVC compatibility
	- intrinsics
	- pthreads
- per-frame timing in the non-incremental API?
- pass frame times as milliseconds and do error accumulation in the library?
- combine header and implementation
	- add boilerplate to toggle profiling macros
- re-allow specifying a stride per row???
- rename everything at global scope to avoid name conflicts
- write documentation

- API for returning a block of encoded memory instead of writing it out with <stdio.h> functions
- allow custom allocators
- async incremental API
- runtime option for channel importance order?
- increase maximum bit depth to 16?
- bitfield for `used` array????



documentation:
	- in file
	- in repository
	- things to cover:
		- use case for this library
			- things this library specifically doesn't do
				- exact colors, fancy GIF features
				- image resizing (use stb_image_resize if you need this)
			- things it doesn't do *yet*, but can be supported upon request
				- support for custom allocators
				- support for writing to a memory block instead of a file
				- async API
				- support for other pixel formats (can provide optimized conversion functions for common ones that arise)
		- how much memory the library will allocate
		- API, parameter-by-parameter
		- compile-time options
	- example code for opengl app (pull from escher)
